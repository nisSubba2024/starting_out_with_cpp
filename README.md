# Starting out with C++ 

This repo will contain all my notes, programming practices, and solution to programming challenges from Starting out with c++ by Tony Gaddis, 10th ed.

The purpose of this is for me to learn low-level langaguge c++ while also understanding fundamentals of software engineering and software development. I want to learn what really happens when you write a program and how does computer executes. I want to more specifically learn more about memory allocation and management.

Please check out my solutions to the programming challenegs from the book.

Best regards,
