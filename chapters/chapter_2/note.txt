Escape sequences
\n new line
\t horizontal tab
\\ backslash
\' single quote
\" double quote

Int size:
int 4 byte -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647
unsigned int 4 byte 0 to 4,294,967,295
long long int 8 byte

Digit separators
You can use single quote to separate the number
amount = 1'000'000
this is same as 1000000

Char type is stored as their ascii equivalent, char is actually an integer type
ex: A = 65, B = 66

Difference between string literals and character literals

Because string literals can be of any length, it is impossible for program to determine when it ends, so it use '\0' to mark end of the string. \0 is an extra byte which is appended to the end of string literals when stored in memory. This is called null terminator or null character and marks the end of string.
Ex:"Sebastian"
this is stored as: S|e|b|a|s|t|i|a|n|\0

Character is stored as:
'A' -> A
"A" -> A|\0

ASCII
'A' -> 65
"A" -> 65|0

Using the string class
#include <string> // preprocessor directive
endl -> end the line and place cursor to next line

floating points
There are 3 floating points: float, double, long doubel
float is single precision and double is double precision

Floating points representations:
decimal
247.91
Scientific notation
2.4791 x 10^2

e notation
2.4791e2

floating can be written as:
num = 14.725f

when float is assigned to int, number will not be rounded, instead it will simply truncate the decimal

bool 1 = true, 0 = false

Determining the size of a data type:
sizeof(int) can be used to determine the size of any data type, which will return the number of byte used by that items


Declaring variable with 'auto' keyword
From C++ 11, you can declare variable with auto keyword
ex:
auto amount = 100;
The auto data type tells the compiler to determine the variables data type from the initialization value.
In this example, amount would be an int because 100 is integer

EX:
auto interestRate = 12.0; // double
auto stockCode = 'D'; // char
auto customerNum = 459L; // long

Alternate ways to initialize a variable:
most common way:
int value = 5;

Alternate method 1:
Enclose the initialization value in a set of parentheses, just after the variable name
EX:
int value(5);

Alternate method 2:
Only after c++ 11, is to enclose the initialization value in a set of curly braces, just after the variable name
EX:
int value {5};
There is advantage to using a braces initialization because it will check for data type.
EX: int val1 = 4.9;
The val1 is a int data type; however, 4.9 is a float value, but compiler will still execute the code and truncate the float into int.
However, with braces, it will check to make sure the value be assigned to val1 is actually an int and give error when compiling.


Arithmetic operates
There are 3 types of operas: unary, binary, and ternary

Multi-level comment:
/*
    PROGRAM: file name
    Written by author name
    What does the program do
    Last modification: date
*/

Named constant
A named constant is a like a variable, but its content is read-only and cannot be changed while the program is running.
EX:
const double INTEREST_RATE = 0.069;

Compiling the code:
mac default:
to compile: clang++ -o executable_file_name file.cpp
to rune: ./executable_file_name
Another way using g++:
g++ -o executable_file_name file.cpp
to rune: ./executable_file_name

Include libraries:
g++/clang++ -o executable_file_name file.cpp -lmylibrary

Enable debugging:
g++/clang++ -g -o executable_file_name file.cpp

Set C++ Standard to specifics which c++ version/standard
g++/clang++ -std=c++17 -o executable_file_name file.cpp
